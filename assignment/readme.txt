GRAMMAR EXPANSION - RICHIE SASEETHARAN:
TODO 1.2 and TODO 1.3 were analog. In TODO 1.2 I iterate over symbol_sequence and I use expandSymbol() to build a text. TODO 1.3 is analog.
TODO 1.1 was nice because I learned how unordered_maps work.

DRAWING - FRANCESCO LAM:
With a for-each I iterate over all the given symbols. Then the switch statement does the distinction of cases.
I did not find difficult to work with the Stack. The variables needed are declared at the beginning of the method.

REVERSE ENGINEERING - ALAN BRAGALINI:
The left_plant and hexerode were fine. They have also been explained in the lesson.
By the flower_plant, it took a looooooooooong while to understand that the "T" also draws a line.
The crossout was tricky, but it worked out, after a lot of trying.
For all exercises, I tried to recognize the initial geometries in the later iterations. Then I wrote Fs and +s and -s in the first and second iterations and tried the combination that made sense out.
