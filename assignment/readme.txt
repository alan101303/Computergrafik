At first glance I didn't notice that it was possible to find t (I mean this t: o+td) in the euclidean space by solving 3 linear equation. After reading the Tipp from the exercise hour about the Cramer's Rule everything went pretty straight forward. The comments in the code explain exaustively the formula that I have used.
